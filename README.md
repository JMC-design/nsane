# nsane
Common Lisp implementation of the SANE network protocol

This package is NOT meant to be :USEd
This is not a frontend, it is just an implementation of the protocol in common lisp so anybody can write a frontend using it.
There is one additional function besides the protocol, RETRIEVE-SCAN that will retrieve and return a scan as vector.
